Hi there! I am an accelerator scientist at CERN, where I work as a Senior Fellow within the CLEAR facility (CERN Linear Electron Accelerator for Research). My work sits at the intersection of beam physics and operations: I support and deliver user experiments, maintain and optimize key beam diagnostics, and lead R&D on machine-learning-enabled accelerator optimization (predictive models and feedback strategies to improve stability and efficiency). 

I earned a PhD in Information Technology (summa cum laude) from the University of Naples “Federico II” (2018–2021). My doctoral research focused on beam-based measurements in linear electron accelerators—specifically wakefield and bunch-length measurements using CLEAR as a case study—with a strong emphasis on beam dynamics, accelerator operations, and optimization. 

Before returning to CERN, I worked at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow (2021–2022), developing ML-based feedback approaches for coherent laser beam combining, spanning experimental data acquisition through model training and closed-loop control prototyping. I then joined SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory as Faculty Staff (Level II) (2022–2023), supporting operations for the MFX hutch and the MeV-UED accelerator, serving as Point of Contact, modernizing controls infrastructure, and contributing to the controls design phase of the LCLS-HE upgrade. 

P.S. I try to keep this profile updated as projects evolve, but if you need a current snapshot (latest responsibilities, publications, or availability), feel free to ping me.
